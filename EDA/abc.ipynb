    "\n",
    "## 1. Data Understanding and Cleaning\n",
    "\n",
    "First, let's understand what we're working with:\n",
    "- The dataset appears to be customer data with 13,417 entries and 54 columns\n",
    "- There are various customer segments, regions, and product usage metrics\n",
    "- We need to address missing values, particularly in columns like `nps_score_all_time` and `avg_nps_rating_all_time`\n",
    "\n",
    "### Data Cleaning Steps:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "# Import necessary libraries\n",
    "import pandas as pd\n",
    "import numpy as np\n",
    "import matplotlib.pyplot as plt\n",
    "import seaborn as sns\n",
    "\n",
    "# Handle missing values\n",
    "# For nps_score_all_time and avg_nps_rating_all_time, we could:\n",
    "df['nps_score_all_time'] = df['nps_score_all_time'].fillna(df['nps_score'])\n",
    "df['avg_nps_rating_all_time'] = df['avg_nps_rating_all_time'].fillna(df['avg_nps_rating'])\n",
    "\n",
    "# Convert score_date to datetime format\n",
    "df['score_date'] = pd.to_datetime(df['score_date'], format='%d-%m-%Y')\n",
    "\n",
    "# Create derived features\n",
    "df['months_since_scoring'] = (pd.Timestamp.now() - df['score_date']).dt.days / 30\n",

    "## 4. Hypothesis Development for Upsell/Cross-sell Potential\n",
    "\n",
    "Based on the data analysis, here are potential hypotheses for identifying high-potential customers for upsell and cross-sell:\n",
    "\n",
    "### Hypothesis 1: High Agent Utilization with Limited Seats\n",
    "Customers with high `agent_utilization` (>0.8) but moderate `max_seats` are likely reaching capacity and may be prime candidates for seat upsell.\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "upsell_seats = df[(df['agent_utilization'] > 0.8) & \n",
    "                  (df['max_seats'] < df['max_seats'].median()) &\n",
    "                  (df['agent_utilization_increase'] == 1)]\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### Hypothesis 2: High Ticket Volume with Basic Products\n",
    "Customers with high `max_tickets_per_agent` but without premium products (`team_plus`, `pro_plus`, `ent_plus` = 0) may benefit from product upgrades.\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "upsell_products = df[(df['max_tickets_per_agent'] > df['max_tickets_per_agent'].quantile(0.75)) &\n",
    "                     (df['team_plus'] + df['pro_plus'] + df['ent_plus'] == 0)]\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### Hypothesis 3: Growing Companies with Standard Products\n",
    "Customers with increasing `product_counts` but without premium features may be ready for cross-sell of additional solutions.\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "cross_sell_opportunity = df[(df['product_counts'] > df['product_counts'].median()) &\n",
    "                           (df['product_counts_percentage'] > 0) &\n",
    "                           (df['customer_age_quarters'] > 2)]\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### Hypothesis 4: High NPS/CSAT with Moderate Product Usage\n",
    "Satisfied customers with high `nps_score` and `csat_score` but moderate `product_counts` may be receptive to additional product offerings.\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "cross_sell_satisfied = df[(df['nps_score'] > df['nps_score'].quantile(0.75)) &\n",
    "                         (df['csat_score'] > df['csat_score'].quantile(0.75)) &\n",
    "                         (df['product_counts'] < df['product_counts'].median())]\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### Hypothesis 5: Enterprise Customers with Limited Product Mix\n",
    "Enterprise customers (`segment_enterprise` = 1) with low `product_counts` compared to other enterprise customers may be missing out on integrated solutions.\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "enterprise_cross_sell = df[(df['segment_enterprise'] == 1) &\n",
    "                          (df['product_counts'] < df[df['segment_enterprise'] == 1]['product_counts'].median())]\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "## 5. Recommendations for Further Analysis\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Segment-Specific Analysis**: Develop separate models for each customer segment to identify unique upsell/cross-sell patterns.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Time-Based Analysis**: Analyze how `agent_utilization` and `product_counts` change over time to identify growth patterns.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Experiment Design**: Create control and treatment groups to test different upsell/cross-sell approaches.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Predictive Modeling**: Develop a predictive model using features like `agent_utilization`, `nps_score`, `product_counts`, and `customer_age_quarters` to predict likelihood of upsell/cross-sell success.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. **ROI Analysis**: Calculate potential revenue impact of targeting different customer segments with specific upsell/cross-sell strategies.\n",
    "\n",
    "Would you like me to provide more detailed analysis in any specific area or develop a particular hypothesis further?"
